    <p>Just saw this dropped in the shared folder... <a href="#">strange_archive_01.zip</a>. No description, just a readme and a weird .dat file. Anyone open it yet?</p>

    <p>I ran strings on the .dat file. There’s some Latin in there: “Cogito ergo sum.” Also looks like there's a line that flashes for a split second in the readme — maybe base64?</p>

    <p>I swear it talked to me for a second — like... actual audio? Not sure. Might be some kind of ARG or just really well-made creepypasta. Still digging.</p>

    <p>Weirdest thing: there's a link in the readme that goes to some kind of "breach briefing." It’s all glitched out, but it almost seems like it’s expecting you to do something. Anyone solved it?</p>

    <p>Not yet. Feels like there’s a second layer to this. Gonna keep digging.</p>
